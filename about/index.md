Hello there!

We're Sue & Michael. We're a husband and wife duo that runs Native Haus, a place for paper goods for the language of your heart.

The idea behind Native Haus came around the time our son was born. Sue's mom was visiting us from Germany and Valentine's day was close by. Michael wanted to buy his mother-in-law a Valentine's day card but realized, she wouldn't be able to understand any of them because they were in English.

Michael's Korean and German (and hand-writing) isn't that good so he didn't make his own. He looked in local stores and even checked online but couldn't find anything in either languages. Michael ended up buying a bouquet of flowers for his mother-in-law, which thankfully is universal no matter what language you speak.

Native Haus was birthed from this lack of paper goods in languages of our heart. Languages that we may not be proficient in but have loved ones who speak it.

Sue brings her creativity, eye for design and nice hand-writing, while Michael brings his illustration and web skills to Native Haus.
